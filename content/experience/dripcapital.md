### Description

- Contributed in a Selenium Testing Framework of which the main libraries used were **Selenium**, **TestNG**, **ExtentReports** and **GithubAction**, this included support of multiple data inputs (JSON, xls, properties).

  - Used Github Actions to publish framework as private maven atrifact in github private artifactory.
  - Used Github Actions to consume the framework inside test repositories.
  - Used _dependabot_ to update all the repositories when a new framework released
  - Used Github Actions to run the framework on _push_, _pullrequest_, and manual trigger

<br>

- Through this, I learned to build framework that can handle multiple UI tests in parallel, wrote **test** for **Admin Application** as well as **Marketing Website**.

<br>

- Did a POC on sending test execution logs to [**Report Portal**](https://reportportal.io/) by deploying its docker container on EC2 instance (Ubuntu).

<br>

- Worked on API Testing using **Rest-Assured** initially, then eventually moved to **Postman**.

<br>

- Did testing of features from **Risk** side before their release on production.
